# Write Poetry

This Docker recipe will use the [things.yml](../things.yml) from this repository
to write... the 12 Days of Halloweenie! You can generate just text, or markdown.
Give it a try!

## Text

```bash
$ docker run vanessa/40-avocados

## Development

Since this container doesn't need changing largely (the content comes from the things.yml online
it is a manual build and push!

```bash
docker build -t vanessa/40-avocados .
docker tag vanessa/40-avocados vanessa/40-avocados:0.0.1
docker push vanessa/40-avocados
```
